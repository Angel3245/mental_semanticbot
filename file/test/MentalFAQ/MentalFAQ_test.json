        "question":"What is a mental illness?",
        "answer":"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital."

Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.

        "question":"Where can I get help?",
        "answer":"Where you go for help will depend on the nature of the problem and/or symptoms and what best fits you.

Having this social support is essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for referrals or recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for mental health resources in your area."

        "answer":"You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you."

        "question":"What should I do if I hear voices?",
        "answer":"Unfortunately, this is the kind of problem you probably will not be able to fix unless you go to a doctor. It is possible you could be schizophrenic, but sometimes there are other reasons for auditory hallucinations. You seem unsure if you are saying things out loud or not which also is not a good sign. I really encourage you to go to a doctor, I would not want things to get worse or more confusing for you."

Express your concern to their mum since she would be able to monitor the situation and possibly get your friend to a doctor. Be supportive to your friend as much as you can."

        "answer":"There is a lot of little things you probably do to put yourself down. The biggest ones (for me) were passing any success off as luck and any mistake was literally only my fault. Self esteem can start by just being kinder to yourself, and owning your accomplishments. You may mess up but instead of dwelling on why you did or did not do next time learn from it."

        "question":"I feel guilty for receiving treatment, is normal?",
        "answer":"Medical care costs in the US are ridiculous. No, you should not feel guilty for getting sick and needing help. Our brains are sick, it is a disorder just like diabetes or epilepsy. You did not choose to be sick anymore than a diabetic chooses to have an insulin crisis or an epileptic chooses to have a seizure. See how ridiculous it sounds talking about those things? Yet, we blame ourselves for mental health issues. It is good you are getting help."

        "question":"why people with a mental illness are so attractive?",

        "question":"what should i look for to reduce emotional intensity?",
        "answer":"Do you mean pharmacological or behavioral? Literally every mood stabilizer and neuroleptic/antipsychotic drug reduces emotional intensity\u2014lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, oxycarbozepine, and to some extent antidepressants, although to a much less extent, hence why bipolar people or people with PTSD or borderline personality syndrome are not stable in A/D\u2019s alone. You might say that anxiolytic drugs reduce emotional intensity as well (e.g. clonazapam is used to treat mania or relapses to mania). Many of the anxiolytics are essentially sedatives or tranquilizers (alprazolam, diazepam)"

        "question":"why is cannabis being legalized?",
        "answer":"Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms."

        "answer":"People tend to use the word \u201caddiction\u201d to mean very different things. \u201cI am addicted to shopping\u201d might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand, \u201cHe is addicted\u201d might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture."

        "question":"why is important to work hard?",
        "answer":"The little word \"Results\" can mean a lot. Tthere are periodic times where you do better and then worse. I would say to better the situation, but not do it drastically is to slowly set marks. You say hard work does not seem like it has a reason one way or another. Then start with easy work. Go with your own tempo. Today's not a good day? Okay, pick up a shirt. Not drained yet-another and so on you repeat till you feel \"Okay this was enough today\" you keep on going."

        "answer": "Equate super high calorie or anything with fiber and high calories. After regular use (like a bottle or two a day) you should get more of an appetite and be able to eat some regular food. Another easy food to down is oatmeal. It is super super important that you are not just drinking protien shakes for people who are going out and working out like the big cans of powder yhey sell at the store, caffeine is going to make things worse too."

A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element.

        "answer": "Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs? This can be an important step! Some people are able to reduce their substance use or quit altogether on their own or with self-help materials. But most of us need support from other people\u2014family members, friends, health professionals, or other people struggling with substance use problems. The right help for you depends on many factors. These include the type of drug you are using, how much and how often, your health and social situation and, of course, your own preferences."
